Step for gathering data to train the model:

-- roslaunch robot_bringup bringup_gazebo.launch
-- roslaunch robot_bringup spawn.launch
-- rosrun robot_core write_csv.py
-- rqt

in rqt:   ---->  plugins,Robot Tools,Robot Steering    (Configure: max angle = 1, min angle = -1, max velocity = 1, min velocity = -1, change topic to /robot/cmd_vel)
          ---->  plugins,Visualization,Image View      (Configure: change topic to: /robot/camera/rgb/image_raw)

          Put velocity at 0.25 all the way  (never change the velocity)

Now, drive the car (only the diretion), only look at the image in rqt, dont look at the gazebo


If your driving was sucessfully save the csv file, if not delete it.

The csv file will be save in the path where you keep did the rosrun
